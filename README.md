# 🏦Bank-Loan-Approval-Analysis🏦

## AI-Powered Credit Risk Intelligence Platform

An end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts loan approval decisions using financial risk modeling and provides business intelligence through an interactive web dashboard.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions must assess loan applications while minimizing default risk and bias. Manual decision-making can be inconsistent, slow, and prone to human bias.

This project builds a data-driven AI system to:

* Predict loan approval probability
* Quantify risk exposure
* Improve transparency through model explainability
* Analyze fairness across demographic groups

---
